1. About MirrorMe!
While staring at a mirror, you should be able to see a beautiful reflection of yourself. However, if these mirrors ceased to exist, would you be able to recreate that image in your mind?
MirrorMe! is an easy to learn brain training game based on symmetry. See the pattern on one side, and recreate its mirror image on the other side. Think, click and go. 
The game will not only make you look and think twice, but force you to adapt to different situations.
